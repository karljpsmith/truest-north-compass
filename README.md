This is the public repo for Truest North Compass. 

This repo contains code for reprogramming the compass using a browser.

To reprogram your compass:
1) Download index.html
2) Double click it. This will run it in your browser.
3) Input your coordinates and then click program
4) *You must put the compass upside down on the screen for it to be reprogrammed* there is an accelerometer and the compass only enters reprogramming mode when upside down.
